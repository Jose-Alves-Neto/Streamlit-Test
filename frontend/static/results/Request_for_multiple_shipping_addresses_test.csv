1,ai,"I'd be happy to help you update your shipping address. To update the quote information, I'll need to know your quote ID. Could you please share it with me?"
2,human,My quote_id is XYZ456.
3,ai,"You've given me your quote ID. Now, could you please tell me the new information you'd like to update for your quote (e.g. country, city, street, door number, postal code, or state)?"
4,human,I need it sent to two addresses.
5,ai,"It seems you provided more information about the delivery rather than the quote update. You've already given me your quote ID as XYZ456, so let's focus on updating the information for this quote.

You mentioned you need it sent to two addresses, but I can only assist with updating the quote information. If you'd like to update the information for the quote, please tell me the new address details, and I'll do my best to help."
